Practice Portal is an online platform that live streams musicians practicing.  Practicing efficiently is a crucial skill all musicians must learn in order to reach their highest potential.  Practice Portal helps musicians do this in three ways.  First they will be able to watch and learn how other musicians practice effectively.  Second, they will be able to interact with other musicians and receive immediate feedback on their own practicing. And third, they will be motivated to be at their best as a a member of a worldwide music community.
